The project implements a user management system using Java that stores data in files. 
It allows creating, reading, updating and deleting user records through a simple text menu.
All user data gets saved automatically to binary files so nothing is lost when closing the program.
For storage it uses an ArrayList to keep users in memory while running and saves everything to a users.dat file when changes happen. 
Backups are made in the backups folder with timestamps to prevent data loss. 
An audit log tracks all actions with timestamps. Searching can find users by name or email.
Everything works offline without databases or internet. The menu makes it easy to use while the code structure shows clear Java file handling. 
Validation ensures clean data while backups and logs add reliability. 
The whole system runs on any computer with Java installed.
This project was one of my first experiences building something real with Java, and it came with many struggles. 
At first, I felt completely lost—I didn’t know how to save data to files, how to validate emails properly, or even how to structure the menu system. 
There were nights I stayed up debugging why the program crashed when loading files, or why the search function wouldn’t find users.
But through trial and error, I learned. I figured out how serialization works to save objects to files. 
I mastered regex patterns to validate emails and names. 
I discovered how ArrayLists grow dynamically, and how to handle errors gracefully so the program wouldn’t just freeze. 
The backup system was especially tough—I had to learn timestamps, file paths, and how to organize versioned copies.
Most importantly, I learned perseverance. When the audit log kept overwriting itself, I read documentation until I fixed it. 
When the CSV exports looked messy, I rewrote the formatting logic three times. 
This project taught me that coding isn’t about knowing everything upfront, but about solving one small problem at a time.
Now, seeing it all work—the CRUD operations, the error validations, the automatic backups—I feel proud of how far I’ve come. 
The confusion I felt at the start has turned into understanding, and that’s the real victory.
